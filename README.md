# SchoolManagementDB
Bootcamp Management Console App

Simple console app that simulates a coding bootcamp administration panel that performs create and read operations against its database.
The project was built as an exercise via Database First development (SQL script included) without an ORM relying sorely on ADO.NET.
The project has a mock 3-tier architeture while the DAL was modelled after the factory method design pattern.
In order for it to work you need to properly modify your App.config (see commit: Add project files.)
